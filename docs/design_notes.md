# Design notes

## `SvgNode` is a reference-counted handle

`SvgNode` wraps an `Rc`, so cloning it is cheap and all clones refer to the same underlying DOM node.
This makes it natural to share a node between an event closure and the surrounding code without the need for any `unsafe` or `Arc` shenanigans.

## Event listeners are owned by the node

Listeners registered through the managed helpers such as `on_click`, `on_mousedown`, `on_mousemove`, `on_contextmenu`, `on_pointerdown`, `on_pointermove`, `on_pointerenter`, `on_pointerleave`, `on_wheel`, `on_touchstart`, `on_keydown`, `on_focus`, and the drag-and-drop helpers are stored inside the `SvgNode`'s `Rc`.
Each stored entry keeps the event type together with its wasm-bindgen closure, so the DOM listener can be removed before the closure is dropped.

The built-in listener helpers use fixed browser event names, so event types can be stored as `&'static str` values.
They live exactly as long as the last clone of the node exists, so you never have to manage their lifetime separately or call `Closure::forget` for normal `SvgNode` interactions.

This lifetime rule is important for long-lived browser demos and applications: if a function creates a DOM node, attaches a managed listener, and then drops every `SvgNode` handle before returning, the listener is deliberately removed. Keep at least one handle to every listener-owning node for as long as the interaction should remain active. The demo gallery does this with a small page-lifetime owner for interactive nodes.

For uncommon browser events, `on_event` provides the same managed lifetime behaviour while using a generic `web_sys::Event`.

## `requestAnimationFrame` self-rescheduling pattern

`AnimationLoop` uses the standard WASM self-referencing closure pattern: the closure holds an `Rc` to itself so it can re-register with `requestAnimationFrame` after each frame.

Calling `stop()` (or dropping the `AnimationLoop`) sets that `Rc` slot to `None`, which prevents the next re-schedule and allows the closure to be freed.

## Per-frame formatting uses a reusable scratch buffer

`AnimationLoop::start_with_frame` supplies an `AnimationFrame` value to each RAF callback.
`AnimationFrame` owns one reusable `String` scratch buffer and exposes helpers such as `set_attr_fmt`, `set_fill_fmt`, `set_d_fmt`, and `set_text_fmt`.

Use these helpers for values that change every frame instead of writing `set_attr(..., &format!(...))` or `set_attr(..., &value.to_string())` inside the RAF callback.

The DOM still receives a normal `&str`, but on the Rust/WASM side, the same allocation is used across frames.

## Transform setters reuse a caller-owned buffer

`AnimationFrame`'s reusable buffer only helps callbacks that run *through* `AnimationLoop`.
Event-driven handlers such as drag, pan/zoom, sliders, knobs, follow-the-pointer cursors, resize/selection handles etc. do not, yet they update `transform` just as often.
Writing `set_attr("transform", &format!("translate({x:.1}, {y:.1})"))` inside a `pointermove` handler allocates and then drops a new `String` on every event - which adds up to unnecessary churn.

`src/node/transform.rs` adds a set of helpers that take a caller-owned `&mut String` scratch buffer, clear it, format the new transform into it, and hand it to `set_attr`.
These are

* `set_translate`
* `set_rotate`
* `set_rotate_about`
* `set_scale`
* `set_scale_xy`
* `set_translate_scale`
* `set_transform_fmt`

Reusing one buffer across calls means no new allocation happens unless the formatted text outgrows the buffer's capacity.
For shapes that the typed helpers do not cover, your escape hatch is `set_transform_fmt`: it accepts `std::fmt::Arguments` so `format_args!(...)` can build any transform string without the heap allocation that `format!` would otherwise incur.

The scratch buffer is deliberately **not** stored inside `SvgNode`.
Most nodes are passive geometry that never animate, do folding formatting state into every node would cause them all to grow while benefiting only a few.
Passive noeds can remain small by keeping the buffer external whilst hot paths can opt in explicitly.
In an event handler, the buffer typically lives in an `Rc<RefCell<String>>` shared by the closures, as the drag/touch demo does.

In spite of the fact that writing into a `String` is infallible, `write!` is typed to return `std::fmt::Error`.
`Error` implements `From<std::fmt::Error>`, mapping to the existing `Error::Dom` variant so the helpers can use `?` without a dedicated error variant.

## Redundant attribute writes are skipped on hot paths

`set_attr_if_changed` reads the current value with `get_attribute` and writes only when it differs.
This avoids a redundant DOM write in high-frequency handlers where the same value repeats between frames such as cursor style, `opacity` flags or selected state.

It is not a universal win and the cost can be bigger than it first appears: `get_attribute` **allocates a fresh `String` for the current value and crosses the wasm/JS boundary on every call**, even when it then writes nothing.
So for values that change on every call (such as a drag `transform`) calling `set_attr` remains the cheaper option, keeping `set_attr_if_changed` as best kept for *occasional* de-duplication rather than a per-event hot path.

## Caller-owned attribute cache for genuinely hot paths

For a high-frequency path where an element's attribute value usually repeats (E.G. a cursor style or `opacity` flag touched on every `pointermove`), using `CachedAttr` (in `src/node/cached.rs`) is preferable to calling `set_attr_if_changed`.

`CachedAttr` remembers the last value it wrote on the **Rust** side, so the unchanged case is a plain `&str` comparison against an owned `String`: I.E. no allocation takes place and no call into JS.

The DOM is touched only on a genuine change and even then, the `String` backing buffer is reused (`clear` + `push_str`) rather than reallocated.

This is the same design used for the transform scratch buffer: the cache is **caller-owned** and deliberately not stored inside `SvgNode`, so passive geometry nodes carry no caching state.
Keep one `CachedAttr` per frequently-updated value (typically captured in an event handler's state), dedicated to a single attribute on a single node.

If that attribute is changed by some other path, call `invalidate()` so the cache does not skip a needed write on the strength of a now-stale remembered value.

The same cache also covers text content via `CachedAttr::set_text`, for the equivalent case of a status readout rewritten with the same string on every `pointermove`.
Dedicate a given `CachedAttr` to *either* an attribute or text content, not both, since they share the single remembered value.

## Multi-attribute updates

`SvgNode::set_attrs` accepts any `IntoIterator` of `(name, value)` pairs where both sides implement `AsRef<str>`.
This keeps the public API ergonomic for string literals and precomputed string values.

Use `set_attrs` when all values are already strings and you want a compact method for setting multiple attributes at once.

## Reusable attribute formatting

`SvgAttrs` owns a reusable `String` scratch buffer, then `AttrWriter` binds that buffer to a single `SvgNode` for chainable writes.
Use this in order to avoid the need to call `to_string()` or `format!` for numeric or formatted attribute values.

The browser still receives one normal SVG `setAttribute` operation per attribute, but the Rust/WASM side reuses the formatting allocation.
The built-in root and batch element factories use the same mechanism for initial numeric geometry attributes, so repeated element creation does not allocate a fresh formatting `String` per element.

For a single numeric attribute updated on a hot path, `SvgNode::set_attr_display` is the lightweight counterpart taking a caller-owned `&mut String` directly (the same shape as the transform setters), without the ceremony of binding an `AttrWriter`.
The convenience numeric setters such as `set_stroke_width` instead allocate a short-lived `String` per call; that is fine for one-off styling but should be swapped for `set_attr_display` (or an `AttrWriter`) when the value is animated.
The same caveat applies to the `Point`/`Size` `get_*_str` helpers, which each allocate; they are documented as one-off conveniences, not for per-event or per-frame use.

## Shared element factory implementation

`SvgRoot` and `SvgBatch` expose the same basic element factories (`rect`, `circle`, `line`, `path`, `text`, and `group`).
Internally, those factories delegate to a shared `SvgFactory` implementation, so shape-specific creation logic and initial attribute writes exist in one place only.

The only difference between the two paths is the append target: `SvgRoot` appends directly to the live `<svg>`, while `SvgBatch` appends to its `DocumentFragment` until `commit()` is called.

# Ideas Considered and Rejected

## Splitting `SvgNode` into passive and interactive types

It was suggested that a benefit could be obtained by splitting `SvgNode` into passive and interactive types.
Only the interactive type would carry the listener storage:

```rust
struct SvgNode {
    element: SvgElement
}

struct InteractiveSvgNode {
    node: SvgNode,
    listeners: RefCell<Vec<EventListener>>
}
```

The motivation was to stop passive geometry nodes from carrying listener state they never use.
This option has been evaluated and **will not** be pursued.

The memory win is tiny because the common case is already optimised.
The listeners field is `RefCell<Option<Box<Vec<EventListener>>>>`, and `store_listener` only allocates the `Vec` lazily on the first `on_*` call (`get_or_insert_with`).
A passive node therefore allocates **no** listener `Vec`; it pays only for the inline field, that is, on `wasm32`, the `RefCell` borrow flag (4 bytes) plus a niche-optimised `Option<Box<…>>` pointer that is `null` when empty (4 bytes), so the saving adds up to on;ly ~8 bytes.

Splitting removes those ~8 inline bytes per node and zero heap allocations, which is negligible next to the `Rc` strong/weak counts and allocation header every node carries regardless.

Against that small saving sit real costs:

* **API surface.**<br>
   Callers must choose passive vs interactive up front.

   Every factory (`rect`, `circle`, `line`, `path`, `text`, `group`) lives in the shared `SvgFactory` used by both `SvgRoot` and `SvgBatch`, so either each factory is duplicated, gaining an `.interactive()` upgrade step, or becomes generic - rippling through two factory surfaces.

   To avoid re-declaring every attribute setter, `InteractiveSvgNode` would also need to `Deref` to `SvgNode`, which is `Deref`-as-inheritance.

* **It breaks the single-identity model.**<br>
  `SvgNode` is `Rc<SvgNodeInner>`, therefore all clones share one ownership root and the listener-lifetime contract ("keep at least one handle alive and the listeners stay alive") depends on that.

  Putting `listeners` on the outer `InteractiveSvgNode` places it *outside* the shared `Rc`, so an "upgrade" forks ownership: the interactive handle owns the listeners independently of any passive clone of the same element. Drop the interactive handle while a passive clone is still alive and the listeners die — exactly the footgun the single-type design eliminates. Restoring shared semantics would require a second `Rc` layer.

So the structurally "trivial" upgrade is semantically a fork of the very ownership the library deliberately unifies, in exchange for ~8 bytes per node.
The lightweight-passive-node property is better served by the existing lazy `Option<Box<Vec>>`, and any need to signal interactivity is cheaper to meet with documentation than with a second concrete type.

## A faster float-to-string crate (`ryu` / `itoa`)

It was suggested that numeric formatting could be sped up by routing it through a dedicated crate such as `ryu` (floats) or `itoa` (integers) instead of the standard library's `Display`.
This was evaluated and **will not** be pursued.

Two things undercut it:

* **It does not fit the hot path.**<br>
  The high-frequency formatting in this crate is the transform setters, which use *fixed precision* (`{:.1}`, `{:.3}`). `ryu` emits the **shortest round-trip** representation, which is a different output, so it cannot replace that formatting at all. It would only touch the default `{value}` `Display` path used at element-creation time and in `set_attr_display` — not the per-event work it was meant to accelerate.

* **The win over std is marginal.**<br>
  Rust's standard `f64` `Display` is itself a shortest-round-trip (Ryū-derived) implementation, so the realistic saving is small and confined to creation-time formatting.

Set against an added dependency in a published crate (which grows every downstream user's dependency tree), the trade is not worth it.
The dominant per-call cost on any real hot path is the `set_attribute` boundary crossing, not the float-to-string conversion, so effort is better spent eliding redundant DOM writes (`CachedAttr`) and reusing format buffers (the transform setters and `set_attr_display`).
