# Design notes

## `SvgNode` is a reference-counted handle

`SvgNode` wraps an `Rc`, so cloning it is cheap and all clones refer to the same underlying DOM node.
This makes it natural to share a node between an event closure and the surrounding code without the need for any `unsafe` or `Arc` shenanigans.

## Event closures are owned by the node

Closures registered with `on_click` / `on_mouseover` / `on_mouseout` are stored inside the `SvgNode`'s `Rc`.
They live exactly as long as the last clone of the node exists, so you never have to manage their lifetime separately.

## `requestAnimationFrame` self-rescheduling pattern

`AnimationLoop` uses the standard WASM self-referencing closure pattern: the closure holds an `Rc` to itself so it can re-register with `requestAnimationFrame` after each frame.

Calling `stop()` (or dropping the `AnimationLoop`) sets that `Rc` slot to `None`, which prevents the next re-schedule and allows the closure to be freed.
